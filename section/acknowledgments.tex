\chapter*{Aknowledgments}
I would like to thank my research supervisors, Professor Ahmet Ay, Professor John Stratton and Professor Vijay Ramachandran. Without their assistance and dedicated involvement in every step throughout the process, this paper would have never been accomplished. I would like to thank you very much for your support and understanding over these past years.
